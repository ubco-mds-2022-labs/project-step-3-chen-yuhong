                                          As soon as you touched the Spark Lance, it started glowing and immersed you in light.
                                          You were startled at first, but soon you felt something, something strange but familiar.
                                          It felt like those sunny afternoons, when you look out from the window, 
                                          everything is so quite under the clear blue sky, you feel peaceful. 
                                          It then felt like the times when you finished the very last exam of the term, you are relieved, and hope
                                          is coming back to you agian.
                                          After that, you felt courage, it was like recieving an quiz score better than you had hoped, you started to believe
                                          in yourself.

                                          Suddenly, You heard a voice in the light: 

                                          "The only way to save the world, is you become the light"

                                          Yes, I can be the light! You thought.

                                          You raised the Spark Lance high:

                                          Ultraman !!!!!!!!!!
