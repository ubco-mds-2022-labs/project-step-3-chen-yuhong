    "### Description\n",
    "MDS Big Advanture is a text-based game in which the player fights aliens on each level of the science building, buy items from Tim Hortons to improve health and strength, while advancing to the MDS classroom. The story of the game happens on an ordinary day in the MDS program, the player finished the morning classes and went to Tim Hortons for lunch. Suddenly an alien invasion took place, and the science building is occupied with the player’s laptop still in the classroom. The player has to retrieve the laptop in order to submit assignments on time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Fighting\n",
    "When the player press 4 to engage with the alien, two dice are rolled to simulate random factors in combat, one for the player, the other for the alien. Player and alien's power in the battle is computed based on the equation power*(1+dice/10). The difference between player and alien's power is the damage inflicted to the losing party. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Buying items\n",
    "The player can buy food from Tim Hortons by pressing 3 and key in the food name. The number of each food the player can buy is limited. The player can get a special item in Tim Hortons if they order a particular food more then one time (Note: it may not be on the menu, there are hints in the game). \n",
    "It is recommended to get all the available foods before engaging the alien captain. \n",
